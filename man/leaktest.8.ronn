## SYNOPSIS

leaktest

## DESCRIPTION

Anon-Workstation specific leaktest.

Advanced users, developers and auditors only!

First installs python-scapy, which is required for this leak test script, then
runs the leak tests /usr/lib/leaktest-workstation/exhaustive_ip_send.py,
/usr/lib/leaktest-workstation/tcp_test.py and
/usr/lib/leaktest-workstation/udp_test.py.

The tester is supposed to run `leaktest` on Anon-Gateway before starting
leaktest on Anon-Workstation.

There are other leak tests as well, please refer to the online
documentation.

## RETURN VALUES

Return codes do not implicate the existence or absence of leaks!
Returns 0, if no script error has been caught, otherwise returns 1.
Please report a bug in case you catch return value 1.

## HOW TO INTERPRET THE RESULT

It requires a background on basic networking, which is unfortunately outside
the scope of this man page and documentation. Online
documentation pages LeakTests and LeakTestsOld contain hints for
interpretation and other leak tests.
