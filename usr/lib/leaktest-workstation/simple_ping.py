# a type defined as ..echo request.., e.g. a simple ping [4].

# The sr1() [6] command will ..send and receive network traffic,
# returning the 1st packet received...
# The notation of ..ip/icmp/data.. is the notation for encapsulation
# of various instances of networking protocols [7].

# and encapsulated inside an IP datagram...
